<!---
I'm a Data Analyst proficient in SQL, Excel, spreadsheets, Tableau, and Power BI, (I use Tableau often and specialize in that but Power BI as an extra skill is fun😅). I specialize in extracting valuable insights from data, and I'm dedicated to making data work for informed decision-making and improved outcomes. With my analytical skills and attention to detail, I uncover trends and provide data-driven solutions. Whether it's querying databases, analyzing data in Excel, or creating interactive dashboards, I'm here to help businesses thrive through data analysis. I like learning, always looking to hear and learn how I can improve.
